# hurlurl, a load balancing link shortener

Hurlurl can take a list of urls and create one url that randomly redirects to one of them.

This could be useful, if you have a large group of people, e.g. on a discord server or a twich stream and you want to send them to different instances of a game or a online whiteboard for example. 
I made hurlurl when I needed to send people to different boards on https://hellopaint.io, for an event we did. 

I guess you could call hurlurl a _social load balancer_ because it load balances people and not http requests. 
Although hurlurl could also be used for traditional load balancing. 

Give it a try on https://hurlurl.com/
